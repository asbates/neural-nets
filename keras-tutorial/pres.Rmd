### What Is Keras


From [the documentation](https://keras.io):

  Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

```


### What is TensorFlow

From [the website](https://www.tensorflow.org):

  TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.

### What Does That Mean

TensorFlow does math good.

Keras uses TensorFlow to do the math for neural networks.

Both can be use from Python and R.

### What Keras Look Like in Python

```{python, eval = FALSE}
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()

```
