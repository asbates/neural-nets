# First Step: The Basics

For this project we are really just getting our feet wet. Statistics courses at SDSU mostly use R (sometimes SAS) so one purpose of this project is to learn a bit of Python. Another goal is to start working with neural networks. We compare neural networks to the more traditional logistic regression as well as elastic net.
